	<P>This summer my family and I are heading to South Africa in late may and early June. We decided to go on such a wild vacation because my older brother, Walker, is leaving to work in corporate America after this summer. Our family decided that this would be a fitting end to the days of summer vacation for my brother.</P>
	<P>I had never expressed any desire to go to Africa simply because it seemed as though I would never be able to go. When my parents told me that they had saved up for the two week safari I did not believe them at first. After the initial shock I felt a rush of excitement wondering about what one might do while they're in such an exotic place.</P>
	<P>The trip is two months away,  but after seeing the pictures of the South African beaches and landscape I wish it would come <del>sooner</del> <ins><b>now</b></ins>. The resort weâ€™re staying at, <abbr title="Five Star Beach and Wildlife Reserve">Oceana,</abbr> is serene and I do not think I have ever seen my father so excited to travel. <a href="https://oceanareserve.com/">Oceana</a> is a five star resort on the beach with beautiful views overlooking the water. I simply cannot wait for the summer of 2017!</P>
